# Arduino-Longboard-Brake
An automatic longboard brake using an Arduino microcontroller

Using an Arduino Microcontroller, we created a mechanical brake that activates when the user falls, or otherwise, gets off their longboard. This is with the hope that the longboard will come to a stop long before it gets lost, damaged or runs into hazards like the road.
